                <dd>Unique players who included this card (helps identify "pet decks" vs meta trends).</dd>

            <h2>Known Data Issues</h2>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>⚠️ Attached Zone Bug</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    Before January 2026, cards which played into the ATTACHED zone (such as weapons or conditions like Last Alliance) were incorrectly tracked and so never registered as "played". These cards will thus show as 0 played across the board. If you see a very low play stat and it is an attachment, disregard the <strong>Play WR</strong> for that card.
                    Events are still affected by this bug and never show as played; this will be fixed in the future.
                </p>
            </div>

            
            <h3>Other Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bot games are excluded</strong> — Games against AI opponents don't contribute to statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample size matters</strong> — Cards with fewer than 50-100 games may have unreliable statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Meta context</strong> — A card's win rate depends on what it's being played against. A "bad" card might just be poorly positioned in the current meta.</li>
                <li><strong>Correlation ≠ Causation</strong> — High win rate doesn't mean the card is causing wins. Strong players might favor certain cards. See Pippin, Hobbit of Some Intelligence carrying a 60% win rate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tips for Analysis</h2>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> When analyzing a specific card, check both Inclusion WR and Play WR. 
                If Inclusion WR is high but Play WR is low, the card might be good to have in deck but situational to play.
                If both are high, it's consistently impactful.
            </div>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use the Players column</strong> to distinguish meta staples from one player's pet tech. A card with 1000 games but only 3 players is one person's grind.</li>
                <li><strong>Filter by competitive tier</strong> to see how cards perform at different skill levels. Tournament data may differ significantly from casual play.</li>
                <li><strong>Compare formats</strong> to understand how the card pool affects individual card performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Use date filters</strong> to track how cards perform after balance patches.</li>
                <li><strong>Share your queries</strong> — Use the Share button to copy a link with your current filters for discussion.</li>

            <h2>About This Tool</h2>
            <p>
                GEMP Card Analytics processes game replay data to provide win rate statistics for the 
                Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game. Data is aggregated daily and includes games from 
                all tracked formats.
            </p>
            <p>
                The archetype detection uses graph clustering algorithms to identify cards that 
                frequently appear together, helping map the deck-building landscape without manual curation.
